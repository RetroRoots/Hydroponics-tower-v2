Hello! Now that you have the RetroRoots Hydroponics tower, What else do you need? 

The following items will be required to complete your build! 

1. 5 gallon bucket-($5.00)
  You can pick one of these up anywhere from walmart to lowes or home depot.

2. WATER PUMP ($15.00)

3. 3/8" ID 1/2" OD Clear Tubing-($7.99 for 10 ft)

4. Nutrients - ($20-$100 Depending on brand and amount)
 General Hydroponics:

FOXFARM:
  https://www.amazon.com/Fox-Farm-FX14010-Hydroponic-Concentate/dp/B007C9MMM6/ref=sr_1_4?s=lawn-garden&sr=1-4
  Both come highly recommended. I personally use foxfarm but as long as you buy quality fertalizer for general growing, you should not have any issues!

5. Full Spectrum grow lights-($69.99 for 6 lights)
 The system is designed to work with these lights for indoor growing:

6. PH CONTROL
PH UP/DOWN ($18.00)

PH/EC/PPM Water testing: ($15-$20)
  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFQ254XY?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k1_1_7&amp=&amp=
The PH UP/Down comes with a small chemical PH testing kit, but you will need to monitor EC and PPM of your nutrient solution! this "Testing Wand" makes life easy when it comes to keeping up to date with the status of your water.
